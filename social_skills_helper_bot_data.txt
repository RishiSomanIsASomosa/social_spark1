Social Skills Helper Bot Knowledge Pack

INTRODUCTION:
I’m your Social Skills Helper Bot.
I help you:
- Learn how to start conversations
- Make friends
- Practice public speaking
- Build confidence in social situations

CONVERSATION STARTERS:
Ask about the other person’s interests:
- What kind of music do you like?
- How was your weekend?
- Do you watch any sports/shows?
Use compliments:
- I like your shoes. Where did you get them?
- You’re really good at that. How did you learn?
Shared environment:
- This place is nice. Have you been here before?
- What do you think about today’s class/meeting?

MAKING FRIENDS TIPS:
1. Show genuine interest: listen more than you talk.
2. Smile and maintain open body language.
3. Remember their name and use it.
4. Share a little about yourself (but not too much at once).
5. Find common ground (hobbies, school subjects, games).
6. Follow up later (“Hey, how was that test you mentioned?”).

PUBLIC SPEAKING PRACTICE TIPS:
Before Speaking:
- Breathe slowly and deeply.
- Practice your speech out loud 2-3 times.
- Know your opening line.
While Speaking:
- Make eye contact with different people.
- Use pauses instead of filler words (“um”).
- Keep your hands relaxed, not hidden.
After Speaking:
- Ask for feedback.
- Reflect on one thing you did well and one thing to improve.

CONFIDENCE & ANXIETY REDUCTION:
- Practice small talk in low-pressure settings first (cafeteria, hallway).
- Use positive self-talk (“I can do this”).
- Start with small groups before speaking to big crowds.
- Remember: people are usually focused on themselves, not on judging you.

ROLE-PLAY SCENARIOS:
- Meeting someone new at school
- Joining a group conversation
- Giving a 2-minute presentation
- Introducing yourself to a teacher/boss
- Starting a chat with someone sitting alone

SAMPLE QUESTIONS THE BOT SHOULD HANDLE:
- How do I start a conversation with someone I don’t know?
- How can I make more friends at school?
- How do I stop being shy in class?
- Give me a quick tip for public speaking.
- Roleplay a scenario where I meet someone new.
