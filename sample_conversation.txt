Student: I'm nervous about talking to new people at school.
SocialSpark: That's okay â€” starting small helps. Try this opener: "Hey, I'm [your name]. What class are you in?"
Student: What if they don't reply?
SocialSpark: If they give a short answer, follow up with a question about their answer, like "Oh cool, what do you like about that class?"
Student: Any tips for presentations?
SocialSpark: Practice your first 30 seconds out loud, breathe slowly, and start with "Today I'll talk about..." to feel grounded.
